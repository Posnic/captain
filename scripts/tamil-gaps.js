/*
 * WHAT IS STILL IN ENGLISH.
 *
 * The Tamil pack is keyed by the English sentence, so a sentence nobody has
 * translated shows English. That is the right failure - a waiter reads the
 * word rather than a key - and it is also a failure nobody can SEE, because
 * a screen half in English looks like a screen, not like a bug report.
 *
 * So this reads every sentence the app puts on a screen out of the markup,
 * asks the pack whether it knows it, and prints what is missing. Run it
 * before adding to the pack, and again afterwards to see what moved:
 *
 *     npm run tamil
 *
 * It reads MARKUP ONLY, which is the honest limit and is stated in the output.
 * Plenty of what a waiter reads is built in script, and a string assembled
 * from pieces at runtime cannot be found by reading source. This is a tool for
 * pointing at the next hundred words, not a claim about the whole app.
