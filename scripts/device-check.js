/*
 * THE DEVICE CHECK, ON A PHONE PLUGGED INTO THIS MACHINE.
 *
 * Owner: "actually let ci want to achieve locally run before commit as pre
 * hook or ai ruleset. reduce actions money please."
 *
 * This is what `device-test.yml` did on a GitHub runner: build the APK, put it
 * on an Android, start it pointed at a server, and read back the one line the
 * app prints about whether its own networking works. The workflow is gone; the
 * check is here.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE COULD NOT JUST MOVE INTO THE COMMIT HOOK WITH THE REST. The
 * browser suite runs in desktop Chromium. The failures this catches are the
 * ones that only happen inside an Android WebView - a fetch that behaves
 * differently under Capacitor, a request shape the platform refuses - and no
 * amount of Chromium proves anything about that. It needs a real Android.
 *
 * So it is NOT in the pre-commit hook: a hook that fails because nobody has a
 * phone plugged in is a hook that gets switched off, and then the suites that
 * CAN run stop running too. It is a command you run when you have changed how
 * the app talks to a server, with a phone or an emulator attached:
 *
 *     npm run check:device                    against the shop's develop server
 *     npm run check:device -- https://...     against one you name
 *
 * With nothing attached it says so and exits 0. That is deliberate: this is a
 * tool, not a gate, and the thing it would be gating is a phone somebody has
 * to go and find.
