/*
 * THE BILL, ASKED FOR FROM THE FLOOR.
 *
 * Owner: "can we add option from mobile take bill from mobile. is it
 * international standard or not ? ... also i was think settlement from mobile
 * app but usually cashier / desktop person only responsible and confirm the
 * settlement not waiter i thought."
 *
 * His reading is the standard one and it is the rule these tests hold:
 *
 *   A WAITER MAY ASK FOR THE BILL. A WAITER MAY NOT SAY IT WAS PAID.
 *
 * The person who takes the order must not be the person who declares the money
 * received, or a cash bill can be closed and pocketed with nothing in the
 * system to disagree. Toast, Square, Lightspeed, MICROS and Petpooja all let
 * the floor fire the bill; none of them settle it on the waiter's word.
 *
 * So most of this is about what the handset REFUSES to do.
