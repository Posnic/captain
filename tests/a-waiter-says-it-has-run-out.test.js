/*
 * "NO MORE FISH." SAID BY THE PERSON WHO HEARD IT.
 *
 * The kitchen tells the floor before it tells anybody with a keyboard. A
 * waiter who heard it had to find whoever runs the till, and in the minutes
 * that took, three more tables ordered it, three more tickets printed, and
 * three tables were told no after they had already chosen.
 *
 * This half sat written and unshipped for a while, and it is worth being
 * precise about why, because it is the same shape as the faults that cost a
 * shop its evening today: the handset code called `POSNIC.askRunOut(product)`
 * and **that function did not exist**. The guard above the call meant it
 * returned early and did nothing at all. A long press that silently does
 * nothing is worse than no long press, because the waiter believes they have
 * told the shop and stops looking for somebody who can.
 *
 * So the sheet is tested here before any of it ships: what it asks, what it
 * answers, and the one distinction the caller cannot get wrong.
