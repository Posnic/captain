/*
 * ADDING TO AN EXISTING ORDER IS THE ORDERING SCREEN, NOT A LIST.
 *
 * Owner: "after order modify and add item from menu. its just showing only
 * menu. actually i want whole UI as same in new order search box, center menu
 * button with categories, efective search and list of items. so properly full
 * fledged add new item stuff."
 *
 * The first version of this sheet gave a category rail and rows and stopped
 * there. A waiter adding a second round to table four got no way to search and
 * no way past twenty-five categories except swiping the rail - while the
 * screen they use for a NEW order has both, two taps away.
 *
 * What makes it the same screen rather than a lookalike is that the rows are
 * drawn by MenuView and the results are ranked by ItemSearch - the two modules
 * the ordering screen itself uses. This file pins that, because a copy would
 * pass a screenshot review on the day it was written and drift by the month.
