/*
 * One order per tap, and one order per cart.
 *
 * Reported from a live floor: an order sent from a handset for table 5 showed
 * up twice on the till, and cancelling one cancelled both.
 *
 * Two things had to be true for that, and both were.
 *
 * THE BUTTON STAYED LIVE while the order was being sent. A loader appeared,
 * but a second tap during the second or two this takes on a shop network
 * started a whole second checkout. On a slow connection that is not a rare
 * accident, it is what anybody does when nothing seems to be happening.
 *
 * AND THE KEY WAS MINTED PER ATTEMPT. This app has always sent an
 * idempotencyKey - the offline queue needs one - but a fresh one on every
 * call, so a QUEUED retry was recognised by the till and a second TAP was not.
 *
 * Both are fixed, because they fail differently. The latch stops a second
 * request ever leaving the handset. The key stops a request that DID leave -
 * on a dropped connection, or from a second handset at the same table - from
 * becoming a second ticket.
 *
 * Ported from Table_Order, where this was written first.
