/*
 * A till that answers and says no has been FOUND.
 *
 * Owner, on his own shop: "captain app keep disconnected. i want right reason
 * with evidence."
 *
 * The evidence, when I went and measured it, was a router at 516ms round trip
 * on an empty channel with 79% signal - saturated. This is one of the things
 * saturating it.
 *
 * WHAT THE SEARCH USED TO DO
 *
 * `probe()` has always told a refusal apart from silence: REFUSED carries the
 * status, UNREACHABLE does not. But it returns `null` for both, so every
 * caller treated them the same:
 *
 *   - the sweep kept going past the till that had just answered 403, and
 *     spent another two hundred requests per attempt proving the rest of the
 *     subnet was empty;
 *   - `probe.lastFailure` is ONE variable and a sweep runs sixty-four probes
 *     at a time, so the one answer that mattered was overwritten within
 *     milliseconds by "nothing there" from an address with nothing there;
 *   - the circuit breaker cooled the till off for fifteen seconds as though
 *     it were dead, so a phone two metres from a working till routed its
 *     orders over mobile data instead;
 *   - and the waiter was told "No till found on this Wi-Fi", which sends
 *     somebody to check a router that is working perfectly.
 *
 * A dead address gives a connection error. Only a server sends back a status
 * code. So a refusal is not a miss - it is the till, found, turning this
 * phone away, usually because the shop has run out of handset slots.
