/*
 * The permissions a handset needs, and the merge that puts them there.
 *
 * Both platform projects are generated and gitignored: `cap add ios` and
 * `cap add android` rewrite them, so anything edited into a generated file is
 * lost on the next run. The declarations live in the repo and the build
 * scripts apply them, which is the only arrangement that survives.
 *
 * The failure mode is what makes this worth a test. A missing declaration is
 * NOT a build error. On iOS the app installs, launches, and is terminated by
 * the system the moment it reaches for the microphone; on Android the page
 * gets a bare permission denial. Both read as a bug in the voice code.
