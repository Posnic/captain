/*
 * NOTHING HIDES UNDER THE CLOCK.
 *
 * Android 15 enforces edge-to-edge: an app whose targetSdk is 35 or higher
 * draws under the status bar and the old opt-outs are ignored. Capacitor 8
 * targets 36, so the day that upgrade shipped, every screen in this app moved
 * up behind the clock, the battery and the signal bars.
 *
 * The web side of that has TWO halves and only the pair works:
 *
 *   viewport-fit=cover   makes the browser report the inset at all. Without
 *                        it, env(safe-area-inset-top) is zero, so a stylesheet
 *                        that carefully steps around the status bar steps
 *                        around nothing and looks correct in every review.
 *
 *   env(...) padding     actually moves the content.
 *
 * Seven of the nine pages had neither, and two had the padding without the
 * viewport - which is the worse failure, because the code reads as if somebody
 * had thought about it.
 *
 * This holds the first half for every page, because that is the half that is
 * invisible in a diff and silent at runtime.
