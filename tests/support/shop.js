/*
 * A signed-in handset at a table, looking at a menu.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SHARED. Two specs need the same journey, and a second copy of a
 * fixture always drifts - which is the exact mistake the menu rewrite found in
 * the app itself, where the ordinary list and the search results had been
 * written twice and quietly disagreed about discounts and stock counts.
 *
 * THE ROUTE IS WALKED, not jumped to. products.html reads state the pages
 * before it write - the branch, the table, the cart - and a handset that
 * arrives there without them shows an empty screen, which is exactly what a
 * shortcut here produced.
