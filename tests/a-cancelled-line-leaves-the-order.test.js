/*
 * A CANCELLED LINE ACTUALLY LEAVES THE ORDER.
 *
 * From a live floor at Azure, 14-09-2026: "item cancel is not working. i
 * cancel one item and updated button. it closed. i dont see any print is
 * printed. also i went again inside same order its not cancelled."
 *
 * Three symptoms, one cause. A cancelled line is KEPT on the screen with
 * quantity 0 so it can be shown struck through - that is deliberate, it is how
 * a waiter sees what was taken off. But the line still carries `item_quantity`
 * from the till, its quantity before the strike, and the payload read
 * `item.quantity || item.item_quantity`.
 *
 * Zero is falsy. So the cancelled dish went back to the till at its ORIGINAL
 * quantity, the till saw an order identical to the one it already had,
 * cancelled nothing, wrote no cancellation into the order's history, and
 * therefore sent no new ticket to the kitchen. The modal closed on success
 * because the save genuinely succeeded - it just said nothing had changed.
 *
 * A reduction from 2 to 1 was never affected, because 1 is truthy. Only
 * cancelling was, which is exactly why it shipped.
 *
 * The till rebuilds an order from the lines it receives, so what is ABSENT is
 * what is cancelled. These pin that.
