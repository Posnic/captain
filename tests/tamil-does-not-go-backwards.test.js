 * TAMIL DOES NOT GO BACKWARDS.

 * A sentence with no translation shows English. That is the right failure and
 * an invisible one: a screen half in English looks like a screen, not like a
 * bug. Left alone, a bilingual app becomes an English app one button at a
 * time, and nobody can say which change did it.
 *
 * So this counts what is still English in the markup and refuses a commit that
 * adds to it. It is a ratchet, not a bar: raise ALLOWED only by translating
 * something, never to get a commit through.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED TO STAY ENGLISH is listed by hand below, because "five are
 * missing" is a number somebody will eventually satisfy with the wrong five.
