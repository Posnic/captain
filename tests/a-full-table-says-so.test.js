/*
 * A table that cannot take another order says so, before the walk.
 *
 * The shop rule is a setting: one open order per table (the default), no
 * limit, or at most N. The server enforces it - there is more than one handset
 * and two waiters can tap Send on the same table in the same second - but a
 * rule only the server knows is one a waiter meets at the END, after choosing
 * the table, adding the dishes and pressing Place Order.
 *
 * This screen greyed out every table that had an order on it, which was right
 * only because the rule happened to be one. The question has to change from
 * "does this table have an order?" to "has this table reached its limit?", and
 * that needs the count, not just the name.
 *
 * Ported from Table_Order, where it was written first. The server half is POS
 * #681; until that is merged the limit arrives undefined, the fallback is 1,
 * and this screen behaves exactly as it did before - which is the point of
 * the fallback.
