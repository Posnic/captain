 * Three tickets on a table is an ordinary thing - a table that orders three
 * times has three tickets, each printed and cooked separately, and the times on
 * the cards tell them apart. What was wrong was the word ACTIVE.
 *
 * The floor draws itself from getTablesWithActiveOrders, which matches
 * `{ sale_process: KOT, payment_status: 'Unpaid' }` - so a table appears
 * because it has ONE open ticket. Tapping it asked for the table number and
 * nothing else, so the panel answered with every KOT ever written against that
 * table name, including ones settled and paid at earlier sittings, under a
 * badge counting them as active.
 *
 * The same shape as the takeaway card an hour earlier: two queries about the
 * same orders, agreeing on one clause and not the other. That is the thing
 * being pinned here, not the strings.
