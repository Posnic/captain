/*
 * A PIN UNLOCKS, A PASSWORD AUTHENTICATES.
 *
 * Owner: "username password not saved already. everytime i need to enter...
 * may we can register like one more native auth like face, fignerprint pincode
 * as per handset." Then, once the token was fixed: "remember the password and
 * have simple auth. i think we already have module of lock i think find that
 * re use."
 *
 * The till has one, called Till PIN Lock, and its rule is the line above. Its
 * PIN could not be shared: it lives in `pin-lock.json` on that machine,
 * encrypted with an install secret, and never leaves the main process. That is
 * the right call for a till and it means a handset needs its own.
 *
 * What it is NOT for is the typing. That was the token: a handset credential
 * lasted 24 hours, so a waiter who does not know the shop password needed a
 * manager at the start of every service. Fixed on the server; a phone now
 * stays signed in for thirty days.
 *
 * WHICH CREATES THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. A phone signed in for a month is a
 * phone anybody who picks it up can take orders on. The answer is not to ask
 * for the password again - that is where we started - it is four digits.
