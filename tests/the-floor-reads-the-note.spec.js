/*
 * THE FLOOR SHOWS WHAT THE KITCHEN WAS TOLD.
 *
 * Owner: "i see notes inside kot print but inside app not showing note (ex.
 * medium spicy). need fix. its important captain know the customization."
 *
 * The note reached the paper and stopped there. A waiter opening a table saw
 * "Chicken Biryani x2" and nothing about the medium spicy - so the one screen
 * where a mistake is still cheap to catch was the one screen that did not show
 * it. By the time the plate is wrong, the dish is cooked.
 *
 * Driven through the real screen: a table on the floor, tapped, and the panel
 * read. Every test that existed for this screen checked names and quantities,
 * which is exactly why a missing note survived.
