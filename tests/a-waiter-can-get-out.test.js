/*
 * A WAITER CAN GET OUT, AND CHANGING THE SERVER DOES NOT WALK OFF.
 *
 * Owner: "no way to change my password or logout? is the way to develop app?
 * no general stuff?" And, separately: "i clicked change server, and choose
 * another way. suddenly screen gone."
 *
 * Both are the same shape of fault: something ordinary that was almost there.
 *
 * SIGNING OUT existed and was reachable only on a shop with exactly ONE
 * branch, because the floor button is Change Branch otherwise and becomes Sign
 * Out only when there is nothing to change to. On a two-branch shop there was
 * no way out at all. It also cleared the menu, the tables and the cart and
 * left the bearer token in place - which now lasts thirty days.
 *
 * CHANGING THE SERVER sent the phone to the sign-in screen with a flag, the
 * editor opened sixty milliseconds later, and the branch auto-load underneath
 * finished and navigated straight back to the floor, behind a loader. From the
 * outside the screen vanished.
