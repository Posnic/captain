/*
 * NO SCREEN STARTS BROKEN.
 *
 * The cart and the discount screen threw "MenuScreen is not defined" on the
 * first line of their startup for five days. Every test passed the whole
 * time. It was found by eye, in a wall of web server output that scrolls past
 * during an unrelated run, which is not a way of finding anything.
 *
 * The reason it hid so well: the handler is async, so the throw became an
 * unhandled rejection shown to nobody, and both screens carried on using
 * their fallbacks. A screen missing half its startup looks exactly like a
 * screen that started.
 *
 * So this walks into every page this app has and asserts it started without
 * throwing. It knows nothing about any of them, which is the point - a test
 * that has to be taught about a screen is a test somebody has to remember to
 * teach, and the next shared script loaded on a page that lacks one of its
 * globals will be found here rather than in a log six months later.
 *
 * It is a smoke test and says so: it proves a page came up, never that it is
 * right. The screens' own tests do that.
