/*
 * A DISH HAS A NUMBER, AND TYPING IT FINDS THE DISH.
 *
 * Owner: "self manage number. app user itself auto assign 1 to 200 for 200
 * items. if enter 33 then it shows. i want so many real practical options to
 * make to so easy."
 *
 * The oldest trick behind a counter and still the fastest one: a waiter who
 * sells the same forty dishes learns their numbers in a week and stops reading
 * the names. Two digits beat four letters and beat scrolling outright.
 *
 * THE NUMBER IS DERIVED, NOT ASSIGNED. It is the dish's position in the menu
 * the till sends, counted straight through the sections - so every handset in
 * the building shows the same number for the same dish without agreeing about
 * anything, and a card printed from that same order matches all of them. A
 * number a phone invented for itself would be a number on one phone, which is
 * worse than none: two waiters would read different dishes off the same card.
