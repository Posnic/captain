 * better. near to that."
 *
 * Two faults in one sentence. The control existed on the menu screen and not
 * in the sheet that adds to an order already on a table - which is most of
 * them - and it was a bare `+`, which on a screen full of ADD buttons reads as
 * "add a row" rather than "sell something that is not on the menu". The till's
 * sale screen has used a lightning bolt for this for years.
 *
 * And the version. It was printed on the sign-in screen only, so the only way
 * to answer "which build am I on" was to sign out.
