/*
 * TAPPING THE TAKEAWAY CARD HAS TO OPEN THE TAKEAWAY QUEUE.
 *
 * Owner: "one order show as take away, when tap, inside shows no active
 * orders."
 *
 * The floor drew that card with the words "Take away". selectTable asked
 * whether the name was "Takeaway". One space apart, and nothing anywhere said
 * so - so the check failed, the else branch ran, and it went looking for a
 * table literally called "Take away". No sale has one: a takeaway carries a
 * dine_type, not a table number. The card was right, the queue was real, and
 * tapping it reported nothing there.
 *
 * Two strings that have to match, written four hundred lines apart, is the
 * thing being tested here - not the strings themselves.
