/*
 * Turning "two chicken biryani and three coffee" into an order.
 *
 * The recogniser is the easy half to add and the hard half to trust. A
 * restaurant is loud, dish names are proper nouns, and generic speech
 * recognition mangles proper nouns more than anything else: "biryani" comes
 * back as "biriyani", "briyani", "bryani", sometimes "brianni".
 *
 * What saves it is that the answer is never open-ended. The words are matched
 * against THIS shop's menu, which is a few hundred items rather than a
 * language, so a mangled word usually has exactly one plausible neighbour.
 * That is also why voice matching is allowed to be tolerant where typing is
 * not: a waiter who types has seen what they typed, and a waiter who speaks
 * has not seen anything yet.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS, ON PURPOSE.
 *
 *   understand()  what was said, as dishes and quantities. It has no opinion
 *                 about what to DO with them.
 *   commands()    what was MEANT: add these, take those off, make it three,
 *                 send it to the kitchen. A waiter at a table talks in verbs,
 *                 and an app that only hears nouns makes them tap for the
 *                 rest.
 *
 * The verbs are a fixed list rather than anything cleverer, because a
 * restaurant needs the same dozen every night and a misread verb is worse
 * than a misread dish: "remove" heard as "add" doubles an order instead of
 * halving it. Where a shop has an AI provider configured the server can do
 * the reading instead (see voice-order-ui.js); this is what every shop gets.
 *
 * Nothing here orders anything. It produces commands for something else to
 * carry out, and the one that reaches a kitchen is never carried out without
 * a person pressing a button first.

   * reading an order off a table is doing. A verb starts a new command and
   * owns every dish until the next verb. "send to kitchen" and its kin own
   * nothing and are moved to the END whatever position they were said in -
   * "send it, and two more coffee" means both, in the only order that makes
   * sense. "clear" goes FIRST, so what follows is added to an empty cart.
   *
   * @returns {Array<{verb: string, lines: Array}>}
