/*
 * Finding an item while somebody is standing at a table waiting.
 *
 * The search was `name.includes(term)`. That finds "Chicken Biryani" from
 * "biry" and from nothing else. It does not find it from "chick biry", because
 * two words are one substring that never appears; and it does not find it from
 * "cb", which is what a waiter who sells it two hundred times a day actually
 * types.
 *
 * Every counter-facing till does the same four things, and they are the four
 * here, in the order they rank:
 *
 *   exact        the whole name, typed out
 *   prefix       the name starts with what was typed
 *   word start   any word in the name starts with it: "biry" finds Chicken
 *                Biryani, "masala dosa" finds Masala Dosa Paper Roast
 *   initials     the first letters of the words: "cb" finds Chicken Biryani,
 *                "mdp" finds Masala Dosa Paper
 *
 * Multi-token and AND-ed, so "chick 65" narrows rather than widens: every
 * token has to match something, which is how a long menu gets down to one row
 * in three or four keystrokes.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT fuzzy in the edit-distance sense. A waiter who types "birani"
 * would be helped by it, but so would every wrong row, and picking the wrong
 * item on a bill is worse than typing one more letter. Prefixes and initials
 * are predictable: the same keystrokes always produce the same order.
 *
 * Pure and exported, so the ranking is testable without a browser. The ranking
 * IS the feature; a change that quietly demotes the row somebody expects first
 * is invisible until a shop complains that the app "got slower to use".
