 * The till has had a dock for this. The handset had nothing at all, which is
 * the wrong way round: the waiter is the one standing next to the customer,
 * and was the only member of staff who could not be told that table nine had
 * asked to drop a dish. They found out when the food came back.
 *
 * WHY A SHEET AND NOT A PAGE. A waiter is on the floor view with tables in
 * front of them and a customer looking at them. A request that needs an answer
 * in the next two minutes cannot live behind a navigation, so it comes to
 * them: a button that carries the count, and a sheet over the screen.
 *
 * IT DECIDES NOTHING OF ITS OWN. Accept and refuse go through the same
 * endpoint the till's dock and the console queue use, so there is one
 * implementation of what accepting a cancellation means and this is a third
 * door onto it rather than a third copy of it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY THROW. A handset that crashes on the floor view because a
 * queue could not be read is worse than one that shows no queue: the waiter
 * still has tables to serve.
