/*
 * Can this handset reach that server, and if not, what stopped it.
 *
 * WHY A SCREEN IS NOT ENOUGH. A shop's phone failed to reach an address that
 * the same phone's browser loaded instantly. Finding out why took a day of
 * photographs of an error message read back over a chat: each round cost a
 * release, an install, and somebody's afternoon, and every answer was one line
 * long. The thing that was missing was never cleverness. It was a way to run
 * the question on a real handset and read the whole answer.
 *
 * So the app can answer it itself, out loud:
 *
 *   - a waiter or a shopkeeper opens Test connection and reads one line
 *   - a build on an emulator runs it unattended and CI reads the same line
 *     out of logcat, which is what stops the next one of these being a day
 *
 * It probes an address and reports. It changes nothing, saves nothing, and
 * needs no credential - there is nothing here a stranger could not learn by
 * typing the address into a browser.
