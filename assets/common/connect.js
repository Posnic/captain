/*
 * How a handset finds the shop it belongs to.
 *
 * The first screen of a device's life, and the one a waiter meets on their
 * first shift. It used to be a text box, which assumes the person holding the
 * phone knows the shop code. The owner knows it. The waiter, handed a phone
 * five minutes ago, does not, and had no way to find out.
 *
 * So the choice is made explicit, in the order a shop will actually use it:
 *
 *   Scan            point at the code by the till. Nothing to know, nothing
 *                   to type. This is the answer for a new member of staff.
 *   Search Wi-Fi    finds the till by itself when they are on the shop's
 *                   network. Nothing to know either, but needs the till on.
 *   Type it         a shop code or an address, for whoever does know one, and
 *                   for a phone that is nowhere near the shop.
 *
 * What a scanned code may contain is deliberately loose - a bare shop code, a
 * full address, or a link carrying either - because the code will be made by
 * whatever is to hand, printed and stuck by a till, and re-made by somebody in
 * a year who will not read this file.
