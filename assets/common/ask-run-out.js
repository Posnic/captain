/*
 * "NO MORE FISH." SAID BY THE PERSON WHO HEARD IT.
 *
 * The kitchen tells the floor before it tells anybody with a keyboard. Until
 * now a waiter who heard it had to find whoever runs the till, and in the
 * minutes that took, three more tables ordered it, three more tickets printed,
 * and three tables were told no after they had already chosen.
 *
 * ONE QUESTION, AND IT NAMES THE DISH. A waiter is holding a phone in one hand
 * next to a table. The thing that can go wrong here is taking the wrong dish
 * off a live menu, so the dish is the largest thing on the sheet and the
 * button says what will happen rather than "OK".
 *
 * IT ASKS THE OPPOSITE QUESTION WHEN THE DISH IS ALREADY OFF, because the
 * gesture is the same one and a waiter who took the wrong dish off needs the
 * way back to be the thing they already know. Same sheet, same long press.
 *
 * FOR TODAY, NOT FOR EVER. The till records the day, not a stock level, so
 * tomorrow's service starts clean without anybody remembering to undo this.
 * The words say so, because "sold out" with no horizon is what makes a shop
 * afraid to use it.
 *
 * Self-contained, its own markup and styles injected once, because it is
 * reached from the menu, the order screen and the kitchen ticket screen, and
 * those three must not answer this differently.
